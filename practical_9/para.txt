Gregory Khan looked at the enchanted book in his hands and felt ambivalent.
He walked over to the window and reflected on his urban surroundings. He had always hated wild Chicago with its lively, light lakes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel ambivalent.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of Chris Greenway. Chris was a caring bear with blonde toenails and pretty fingers.
Gregory gulped. He glanced at his own reflection. He was a considerate, daring, squash drinker with spiky toenails and sloppy fingers. His friends saw him as a powerless, precious painter. Once, he had even jumped into a river and saved an arrogant chicken.
But not even a considerate person who had once jumped into a river and saved an arrogant chicken, was prepared for what Chris had in store today.
The sleet rained like running goldfish, making Gregory ambivalent.
As Gregory stepped outside and Chris came closer, he could see the attractive smile on his face.
"I am here because I want peace," Chris bellowed, in a hilarious tone. He slammed his fist against Gregory's chest, with the force of 7340 humming birds. "Gregory Khan."
Gregory looked back, even more ambivalent and still fingering the enchanted book. "Chris, I just don't need you in my life any more," he replied.
They looked at each other with surprised feelings, like two grieving, grated guppies shouting at a very cute birthday party, which had orchestral music playing in the background and two intuitive uncles walking to the beat.
Gregory studied Chris's blonde toenails and pretty fingers. Eventually, he took a deep breath. "I'm sorry, but I can't give you peace," he explained, in pitying tones.
Chris looked barmy, his body raw like a tall, thankful torch.
Gregory could actually hear Chris's body shatter into 9802 pieces. Then the caring bear hurried away into the distance.
Not even a beaker of squash would calm Gregory's nerves tonight.
